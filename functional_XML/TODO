* Handle tag and attribute names safely? For example:

        PXML::Element->new("<>", {"/"=>1}, [])

  will currently serialize to something like <<> /="1"></<>>

* use `HTML::Element`, as base class? Of course that won't work for
  general XML. LibXML for the latter? Well.. Perhaps parametrizable? 

* how are the rules with regards to URL escaping? No escaping, right?
  So should actually be fine? Check in detail, tests.

* tests are scattered to functional_XML/{test,testlazy},
  functional_XML/t/*, and lib/PXML/Preserialize/t.pm and
  lib/PXML/Serialize/t.pm, which is probably too much of a mess.

* clean up PXML::Serialize, it's an awful mess now (undo all those
  useless constant optimizations)

* make a proper hierarchy (PXML::Element and PXML::Body should
  probably have a common base class), move code to proper locations.

* optimization: examine whether it would be worthwhile to use mapping
  functions that reuse inputs if unchanged
