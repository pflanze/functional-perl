The *.md files support standard Markdown format but with the following
additions:

 - files are expected to carry a header like

    "(Check the [Ml2json website](http://ml2json.christianjaeger.ch/) for
    properly formatted versions of these documents.)

    ---
    "

   which is stripped from the file

 - local urls starting with // are resolved to the path where the file
    with the given filename resides. Example:

     [better_Id_generation](//better_Id_generation.md)

   is being resolved to

     <a href="../bugs/suggestions/better_Id_generation.xhtml">better_Id_generation</a>

   or similar.

 - wiki style links like:

    [[better_Id_generation]]

   or

    [[better_Id_generation|better ID generation]]

   are supported.
